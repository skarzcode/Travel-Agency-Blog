***NOTE: The final project will not have images or links, but you can research how to add these in!***

## Project Specs
Your final page should have all of the following:

### Files
- An `index.html` file with boilerplate code.

### Tags
- A `title` tag within the `head` tag that contains the title of your page
- A page title that uses a `h1` tag
- A tagline beneath the title that uses a `h4` tag.
- At least one sentence describing your travel agency using a `p` tag to contain the text.
- Create a bulleted list that will contain a list of sites to see in the location you are describing
- Create a numbered list that will hold an itinerary. This can describe the top 5 things to do in the location you are describing
